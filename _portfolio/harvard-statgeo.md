Given a collection of objects, how can we described their mean and primary modes of variation? What are the best point-to-point alignments between curves in space, whether closed or open?  

Functional data analysis (FDA) is an area of statistical geometry that can be used to answer these questions. Currently, I'm working on applying these analytical methods to various biological datasets to develop better, lower-dimensional characterizations of shape and understand morphological diversification.
