To evaluate the state of fisheries 

I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (a 10-week, NSF-funded summer research program) at the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. I modeled the distributions Pacific cod within the Bering Sea region, and examined their growth rate with respect to environmental variables. Additionally, I made a statistical simulation of the current sampling process to quantify bias in predicted growth rates due to sampling methods. This work culminated in a poster presentation at the International Conference for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in Copenhagen, September 2015.
