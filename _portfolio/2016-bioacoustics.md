I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates hosted by the Engineers for Exploration research group at UCSD. I worked in an intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and bioacoustics to develop an algorithm for automatically detecting and classifying humpback whale social calls within large underwater audio recordings.
