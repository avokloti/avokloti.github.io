What are the best point-to-point alignments between curves in space, whether closed or open? Given a collection of shapes, what is a representative mean? How can we characterize the primary modes of variation within a shape dataset?

Functional data analysis (FDA) is an area of statistical geometry that can answer these questions. Currently, I'm working on applying these analytical methods to various biological datasets to develop better, lower-dimensional characterizations of shape and to understand morphological diversification.
