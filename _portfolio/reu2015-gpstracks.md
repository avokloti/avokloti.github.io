I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, located on the coast of Oregon. I studied GPS tracking data of grey-headed albatrosses from Campbell Island, NZ, and developed a new method of quantifying animal foraging behavior from tracking data, and differentiating between multiple behavior states. This work culminated in a publication in PLOS ONE (2017).
