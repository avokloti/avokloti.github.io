As high-resolution biologging technology becomes more readily accessible, there is a growing demand for methods of animal movement analysis. Previous studies have focused on evaluating area-restricted search (ARS) behavior within tracking data through time-dependent metrics, which can give erroneously high values for non-ARS behaviors. Furthermore, there have not been general, objective methods for classifying animal behaviors from tracking data. This study aims to improve current methods for evaluating ARS by introducing a metric based on distance rather than time. In addition, we develop a method for differentiating between major behavior states (foraging, resting, and transit behaviors), and discuss its use at various scales.  

This project resulted in a [PLOS ONE publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168513), in which the proposed method is applied to track datasets across many taxa and regions.
