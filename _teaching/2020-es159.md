I was a teaching fellow for Harvard's undergraduate and graduate course Engineering Sciences 159/259: "Introduction to Robotics", which covered kinematics, dynamics, control, path planning, and contemporary research topics. My responsibilities included developing biweekly labs, holding office hours, and grading. In particular, due to COVID-19, I was responsible for establishing a path-planning framework in a simulation environment as an alternative to running experiments in hardware.
