I was a teaching fellow for Harvard's undergraduate course Computer Science 182: "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence", which covered search algorithms, Markov models, Bayesian networks, reinforcement learning, classification problems, and motion planning for robotics. My responsibilities included teaching weekly section, developing course materials, mentoring students on final projects, and overseeing the class forum.
