Hi! I am a PhD student in applied mathematics at Harvard. My research interests span across math and computer science, including **optimization**, **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **acoustics**. In particular, Iâ€™m very passionate about applications of these methods for wildlife conservation.

I will be graduating in December 2022, and am **interested in postdoctoral opportunities** in acoustic biodiversity monitoring, or other topics in computational conservation, sustainability, and social impact.
