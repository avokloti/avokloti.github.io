Hi! I am an [Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Scholar](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/postdoctoral-scholars-program/) at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Previously, I completed my bachelor's degrees in applied mathematics and computer science from the University of Washington, followed by a PhD in applied math at Harvard. My graduate research has been composed of interdisciplinary projects, incorporating **optimization**, **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **acoustics**. As a postdoc, I am working on linking these techniques with wildlife conservation through the improvement of **automated passive acoustic monitoring systems**. In particular, my current focus is in the development and implementation of robust methods for **sound source separation and localization**. I'm also interested in broader applications of technology for wildlife conservation, sustainability, and social impact.
