I am an Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Scholar working with the **K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics** at the **Cornell Lab of Ornithology**.

My work has been defined by an interest in mathematics and a passion for wildlife conservation. I completed my bachelor's degrees in applied math and computer science from the **University of Washington**, followed by a PhD in applied math at **Harvard**. As a graduate student, I worked on interdisciplinary projects incorporating optimization, machine learning, and robotics.

In the latter half of my PhD, I transitioned to adapting techniques from these fields for the development of **conservation technology**. I am now working on improving **automated passive acoustic monitoring** of vocal wildlife, with a particular focus on the development and implementation of robust methods for **sound source separation and localization**. I'm also interested in broader applications of technology for sustainability and social impact.
