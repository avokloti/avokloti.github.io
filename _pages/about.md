Hi! I am currently a 5th-year PhD student in applied mathematics at Harvard. My research interests span across math and computer science, including **optimization**, **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **acoustics**. In particular, Iâ€™m very passionate about applications of these methods for wildlife conservation through **automated biodiversity monitoring**.
