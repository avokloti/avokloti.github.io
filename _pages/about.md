Hi! I am currently a 3rd-year PhD student in applied mathematics at Harvard. My research interests span across applied math and computer science, including optimization, machine learning, robotics, statistical geometry, and acoustics. In particular, Iâ€™m very passionate about applications of these methods for sustainability, environmental monitoring, and wildlife conservation.
