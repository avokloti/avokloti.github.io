Education
======
* B.S. in Applied Math: Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Washington, 2017
* B.S. in Computer Science (with Honors), University of Washington, 2017
* Ph.D in Applied Mathematics, Harvard University, 2023 (expected)

Research experience
======
  * Summer 2016: NSF Research Intern
  * University of California, San Diego, CA.
  * Worked with Prof. Ryan Kastner.
  * I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates hosted by the Engineers for Exploration research group at UCSD. I worked in an intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and bioacoustics to develop an algorithm for automatically detecting and classifying humpback whale social calls within large underwater audio recordings.
  
  * Summer 2015: NSF Research Intern
  * Hatfield Marine Science Center, Newport, OR
  * Worked with Prof. Leigh Torres.
  * I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates at the Hatfield Marine Science Center, located on the coast of Oregon. I studied GPS tracking data of grey-headed albatrosses from Campbell Island, NZ, and developed a new method of quantifying animal foraging behavior from tracking data, and differentiating between multiple behavior states. This work culminated in a publication in PLOS ONE (2017).
  
  * Summer 2014: NSF Research Intern
  * Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR
  * Worked with Prof. Lorenzo Ciannelli.
  * I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (a 10-week, NSF-funded summer research program) at the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University. I modeled the distributions Pacific cod within the Bering Sea region, and examined their growth rate with respect to environmental variables. Additionally, I made a statistical simulation of the current sampling process to quantify bias in predicted growth rates due to sampling methods. This work culminated in a poster presentation at the International Conference for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in Copenhagen, September 2015.
