Apart from my work, I really enjoy **art and photography** --  particularly to convey the inexplicable beauty of the natural world. I like to sketch with pen or pencil, have explored digital and vector graphics, and have some past experience with oil painting and pastels. Below are some of my sketches, along with a charcoal portrait of my grandfather.

Throughout my time at Harvard, I was part of the **founding leadership team of the Graduate Photo Society** (and was president for 2019-2021), and have organized trips, semesterly photo competitions, guest speakers, annual family photoshoots, and filmed/photographed events for numerous organizations on campus. Here's a small gallery of photos I had on hand from over the years -- more coming soon!
