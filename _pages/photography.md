Apart from my work, I like to spend time outdoors, particularly with hiking and photography. For the last few years, I've been part of the leadership team for the Harvard Graduate Photo Society, and have organized trips, photo competitions, guest speakers, and photographed events for numerous organizations on campus. Here's a small gallery -- more photos coming soon!
